Proof of concept/ ideation for a spell casting system. 
The goal is to have different components and elements that can be used
as ingredients for spell casting.
Inspiration for this system was drawn from table top role playing games such as 
Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition and Pathfinder 1st and 2nd editions. 
This small demo only includes a few elements and runes/ shapes with basic effects.
