Description

KOROHANZA is an odd font based on a series of magical characters described by 15th century Tyrolian alchemist Pietro Ulstadt in his work "Das Buch Korohanza," and only slightly elaborated on in his seminal "Secreto della tramutatione metallica." Since Ulstadt's works contained over 300 such characters and symbols, I've included only a few, and have arbitrarily assigned upper and lower cases, numerals, punctuation, even some diacriticals--but hey, who can tell what's what? Only a long-dead Tyrolian knows the difference.

Okay. The truth is, I really just made up all that stuff about Ulstadt. I made this font--but the other story sounds better. See if you can figure out a good use for this font; I sure can't. You could use it to send secret messages to your pals, or maybe to ad an exotic, decorative touch to otherwise drab correspondence. Sets well at small to medium point sizes.

Installing KOROHANZA

MACINTOSH:

For System 7 and above, just drag both the "Korohanza.bmap" and the "Koroh" files onto your system folder icon. Finder will prompt you whether or not to add them to your Fonts folder; click OK and you're set! If you're using font management software like Suitcase, consult your user's manual for further instruction.

WINDOWS:

Windows 3.1: Open the control panel and choose FONTS
Click the ADD button, find the TrueType font, and click OK.

Windows 95 and above: Open the Windows FONT folder; click, drag, and drop the TrueType font inside.


You may use this font in any of your projects. If you find an actual use for this font, drop me a line.
